## This is my attempt at replicating Invoker’s mechanic in Unity3D. The casting of 3 reagents is done along with invoking. However, only a few invoke spells are functional at this time. Spells and their parameters work as closely as the values of the actual game.

## [DOTA 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2)
“is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players.”

## [Invoker](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Invoker)
“is a ranged intelligence hero who is very difficult to master. He is unique in that he possesses a total of 14 abilities in his arsenal; three of them – Quas, Wex, and Exort – are reagents and one is his special ultimate Invoke. The three abilities he learns throughout leveling up can have three instances, which serve as the basic ingredients or components for him to create a new ability using his ultimate. Once the reagents or elements are combined, he can invoke one out of ten different abilities. All of his invoked abilities are capable of a multitude of actions, from damaging enemies to aiding his allies, and even saving himself from danger.”
